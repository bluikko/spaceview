## A thingy called spaceview that needs a better name

This project is an experiment to provide a simple web-based disk usage visualizer, targeting mainly Unix servers.

The plan:
* Run some simple `sh`-oneliner to list disk contents.
* Transfer the data somehow to this thingy and a disk usage visualization is generated.
